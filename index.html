        <h2>What is Bouldering?</h2>
          <p class = accent>Bouldering is a form of rock climbing that is performed on small rock formations or 
          artificial rock walls without the use of ropes or harnesses.</p> 
          
          <p>Unlike <a href="getting-started.html">traditional climbing</a>, bouldering focuses on short but intensive routes called "problems," typically keeping climbers within a safe distance from the ground while they navigate challenging sequences of moves.</p>
          <div class="dave-bg">
          <p>Experience the perfect blend of <strong>physical challenge and mental puzzle-solving</strong> as you navigate routes close to the ground,with nothing but a crash pad and determination.</p>
          
          <p>Bouldering strips climbing down to its purest form, making it both <strong>accessible to beginners and endlessly challenging for experts</strong>.</p>
          </div>
